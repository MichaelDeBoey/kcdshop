# Video Player

The EpicShop video player provides a rich, interactive video experience with
keyboard shortcuts, transcripts, and seamless integration with Epic Web content.

## Components

### `<EpicVideo />` Component

The `<EpicVideo />` component is the main video player that can be used in MDX
files to embed Epic Web videos with enhanced features.

#### Basic Usage

```mdx
<EpicVideo url="https://epicweb.dev/workshops/react-hooks/01.problem.basic" />
```

#### Props

- `title` (optional): Custom title for the video. If not provided, the title
  will be extracted from the URL (best effort)

  right corner

#### Examples

```mdx
<!-- Basic video with auto-extracted title -->

<EpicVideo url="https://epicweb.dev/workshops/react-hooks/01.problem.basic" />

<EpicVideo
	url="https://epicweb.dev/workshops/react-hooks/01.problem.basic"

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The video player supports comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for enhanced user
experience:

### Playback Controls

- **j**: Seek backward 10 seconds
- **l**: Seek forward 10 seconds
- **Left Arrow**: Seek backward 10 seconds
- **Right Arrow**: Seek forward 10 seconds

### Frame-by-Frame Navigation

- **Comma (,)** (when paused): Go to previous frame
- **Period (.)** (when paused): Go to next frame

### Volume Control

- **Up Arrow**: Increase volume by 10%

### Quick Seek

- **0-9**: Seek to percentage of video (0 = 0%, 1 = 10%, ..., 9 = 90%)

### Smart Focus Handling

The keyboard shortcuts are intelligently handled:

- Shortcuts are ignored when focus is on interactive elements (inputs, buttons,
  etc.)
- When multiple video players are present, shortcuts control the focused player
- If no player has focus, shortcuts control the first player on the page
- Meta/Ctrl key combinations are ignored to prevent conflicts with browser
  shortcuts

## Error Handling

The video player gracefully handles various error scenarios:

- **Region Restrictions**: Shows upgrade prompts for restricted content
- **Authentication Errors**: Provides login/upgrade links
- **Network Issues**: Shows offline indicators
- **Invalid URLs**: Displays error messages
- **Missing Transcripts**: Falls back to basic video embed

## Integration with Epic Web

The video player is specifically designed to work with Epic Web content:

- Automatically extracts titles from Epic Web URLs
- Handles special URL patterns for different Epic Web domains
- Integrates with Epic Web authentication and licensing
- Supports both problem and solution video variants
- Provides seamless fallbacks for different access levels
