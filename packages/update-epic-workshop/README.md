# update-epic-workshop

This is intended to be run in repositories that are a part of the
[EpicWeb.dev](https://www.epicweb.dev) workshop series.

```
npx update-epic-workshop
```

This now simply runs `npx --yes @epic-web/workshop-cli@latest update` to update
via the workshop-cli.

It will no longer be recommended to run this script.
